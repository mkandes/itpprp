CHANGELOG : ITPPRP

dev

    * developing some minor improvements to provide additional 
      flexability for initial state wave functions that will be helpful
      in studying the Thomas-Fermi approximation for a quantized vortex
      derived in one of the appendices of M. C. Kandes, "Modeling the 
      Effects of Inertial Forces on Bose-Einstein Condensates in 
      Rotating Frames of Reference", Ph.D. dissertation, Claremont 
      Graduate University & San Diego State University (2015).

2016/09/09 v0.9.0

    + a rebuild of ITPPRP from M. C. Kandes, "Multimode Interferometry 
      of Bose-Einstein Condensates in a Circular Waveguide", M.S. 
      thesis, San Diego State University (2009), which contains a copy 
      of the original source code for the project in one of its 
      appendices.
