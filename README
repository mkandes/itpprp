DESCRIPTION

    ITPPRP is a Fortran-based program that finds the ground state wave 
    function of the two-dimensional, time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii 
    equation in a polar coordinate system by using imaginary time 
    propagation. 

    ITPPRP is a modified version of NLSPRP written to propagate in 
    imaginary time. As such, ITPPRP also uses the Peaceman-Rachford 
    finite difference scheme to numerically approximate the solutions of
    the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, with the azimuthal periodic boundary
    conditions handled by employing the Sherman-Morrison algorithm. Zero 
    Dirichlet boundary conditions are used at the inner and outer radial
    boundaries of the computational grid.

USAGE

    make
    nohup ./itpprp.x < itpprp.in &
